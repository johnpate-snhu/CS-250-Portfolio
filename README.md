How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To interpret user needs and implement them you first need to listen to the users, ask the users questions to clarify
and make sure you know what problem they want to be solved. User stories help accomplish this goal by giving short descriptions of the desired
feature from the user, which help the developerrs understand what the user is expecting. As well user stories will usually tell a developers why 
a user desires that function, which can assist the developer in programing the feature to better suit the users needs. 

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I have, in the past, usually not thought too hard on how I approach developing programs. I would often develop programs by just jumping straight in and 
starting to code, however this class has shown me that there are more ways to approach developing than I use to know. I hope to incorperate many agile 
processes into my future indevers, like sprints, and itererative development, so that when problems or changes arise in my code I will be able to 
quickly adapt to them.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I would say the main two things about being a good team member in software development would be collaboration and communication. Every team needs members who can 
collaborate well with each other, and without communication it becomes a struggle to collaborate.
